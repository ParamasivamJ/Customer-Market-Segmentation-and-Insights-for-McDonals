- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and gain insights into customer preferences.
- Market Segmentation: Apply clustering algorithms such as k-means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers based on their attributes.
- Segment Profiling: Analyze the characteristics and preferences of each segment to develop profiles and understand their unique needs.
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests to validate segment differences and explore relationships between variables.
- Segment Interpretation: Interpret the segmentation results and provide actionable insights for McDonald's marketing and operations teams.
